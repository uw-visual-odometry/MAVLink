This MAVLink subsystem facilitates communication between onboard devices of the BlueROV2, including the Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi, to relay important data such as depth, altitude, and pose information. 
It supports integration with ROS2 and visual odometry systems like ORB-SLAM3 for enhanced navigation capabilities underwater.

The system is modular and composed of four key components, each focusing on specific aspects of the MAVLink data pipeline.
